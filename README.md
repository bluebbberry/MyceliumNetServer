# OpenFL

A decentralized federated learning system inspired by P2P file sharing networks like Napster.
This app enables distributed machine learning across multiple nodes without requiring a central server, while optimizing bandwidth usage through gradient compression techniques.
Users can train a model for a given machine learning problem with their local data and receive gradient updates from other users of the app to improve their own model.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central server required - all nodes communicate peer-to-peer
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Top-k gradient compression reduces network traffic by up to 90%
- **Asynchronous Training**: Nodes can train and share updates independently
- **Automatic Peer Discovery**: Nodes automatically discover and connect to other peers
- **Gradient Aggregation**: Averaging of model updates across the network

## How to Use:

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the demo:

```
python main.py
```
